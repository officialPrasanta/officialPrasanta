<p style="font-family:Open Sans; font-size:14px">I am Prasanta Roy Choudhury. I believe every language has its own beauty, restrictions, and remarkable efforts by each community. So off and on, I like to try out different "Hats" and enjoy the beauty of each programming language.
<br><br>Currently, I am vested in Flutter Framework and NodeJs for mobile application development. Keep trying new things with Deep Learning... ðŸ˜Š

Hope you will find some helpful content here...
